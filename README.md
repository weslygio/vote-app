# Vote App

A simple voting dapp that allows users to host a voting and vote on existing ones.

As a hoster, you can list the candidates for the voting and set the voting time. Specified allowed voters will be able to vote on one of the candidates.

The voting result is shown after the voting time is over.

This project is built using [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2).
